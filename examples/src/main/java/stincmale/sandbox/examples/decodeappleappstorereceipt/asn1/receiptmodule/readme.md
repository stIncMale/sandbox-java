These classes were generated with the compiler from the [ASN1bean](https://www.beanit.com/asn1/) library from the ASN.1 definition in the file
[app-store-receipt.asn](https://github.com/stIncMale/sandbox/blob/master/examples/src/main/asn/stincmale/sandbox/examples/decodeappleappstorereceipt/app-store-receipt.asn).
In order to generate the classes, the following command was run:

```
asn1bean-compiler -f app-store-receipt.asn -p stincmale.sandbox.examples.decodeappleappstorereceipt.asn1
```
